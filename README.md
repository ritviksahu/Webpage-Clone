<h2>Amazon Webpage Clone using HTML and CSS.</h2>
<br>
1. It is a project that replicates the visual appearance and layout of the Amazon website using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).<br>
2. Creating a clone involves mimicking key design elements, such as the header, navigation bar, product listings, and footer, to capture the overall look and feel of the Amazon website.

<b><i>Note:</i></b> While it's a learning exercise for web development enthusiasts, it's important to note that a clone is meant for educational purposes and should not be used for any commercial or deceptive activities. This project allows individuals to practice and showcase their HTML and CSS skills by replicating the user interface of a well-known e-commerce platform.
